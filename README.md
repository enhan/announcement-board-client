=========================

This is a sample to show what can be done with angularJS

At the moment it does nothing. To play with it, make sure you have nodejs and grunt installed
Then do : 

- npm install
- grunt bowerInstall
- grunt serve

It will start everything for you (including a fake server which mocks the API of a real server - not yet on github)
